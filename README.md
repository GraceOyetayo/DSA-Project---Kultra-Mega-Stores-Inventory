FROM kmscase
GROUP BY product_category
ORDER BY sales_per_category DESC`

ANSWER

order by total_sales  asc`

ANSWER: 
- Nunavut	116,376.48
- Northwest Territories	800,847.33
- Yukon	975,867.37


`SELECT top 3

4. Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom 10 customers

`select 
Customer_Name, region, province,

Muhammed Lee AtlanticNewfoundland	9.37
Roland Murray	Prarie	Manitoba	10.94

Anne McFarland	West	British Columbia	11.7
Ben Peterman	Ontario	Ontario	13.53
Aaron Bergman	Nunavut	Nunavut	14.76
