#### Case Scenario I 
1. Which product category had the highest sales? - Technology

`SELECT product_category, 
	  max(sales) as max_sales,
	  round(sum(sales), 2) as sales_per_category
FROM kmscase
GROUP BY product_category
ORDER BY sales_per_category DESC`

ANSWER
Technology	89061.05	5984248.18

The highest sales were made from the Technology category; it is also the category where about 54% of the profit in the last four years has been gotten.

2. What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales? 

`SELECT top 3 
  region, 
	sum(sales) total_sales
from kmscase
group by region
order by total_sales  asc`

ANSWER: 
- Nunavut	116,376.48
- Northwest Territories	800,847.33
- Yukon	975,867.37


`SELECT top 3
region, 
	sum(sales) total_sales
from kmscase
group by region
order by total_sales  desc`

Answer: 
 -   West	3,597,549.28
 -  Ontario 3,063,212.48
 -  Prarie	2,837,304.60

West, Ontario, Prairie has the top sales by region while Nunavut, Northwest Territories, and Yukon has the lowest sales region


3. What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario? 

`select region, 
	sum(sales) as sales
from KMscase
where region = 'Ontario'
and product_sub_category = 'Appliances'
group by region`

Total sales made in the region Ontario is N202,346.84 


4. Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom 10 customers

`select 
Customer_Name, region, province,
	round(sum(sales),2) as revenue 
from KMSCase
group by  Customer_Name, region, province
order by revenue asc`
 

Andy Reiter	Quebec	Quebec	3.42
John Grady	West	British Columbia	5.06
Muhammed Lee AtlanticNewfoundland	9.37
Roland Murray	Prarie	Manitoba	10.94
Rose O'Brian	West	Alberta	11.08
Julie Kriz	Atlantic	Nova Scotia	11.57
Anne McFarland	West	British Columbia	11.7
Ben Peterman	Ontario	Ontario	13.53
Aaron Bergman	Nunavut	Nunavut	14.76
Grant Thornton	Quebec	Quebec	16.6

As customer name is not unique, region and province are added to the grouping to ensure each customer in the region even if same name is accounted for.
We have a total of 1,538 unique customer

Further querying into these customers shows they only placed one order in the four years period.
This dataset do not show further details into why these customer stopped placing orders as according to order status only one of these orders were returned and most also had short delivery timeline.
